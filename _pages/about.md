I am a young researcher based in Japan since 2008. I was born in Gyeongju, Korea.I joined Nagoya University, where I was majored in Engineering, especially having insterests in plasma physics and controlled fusion; plasma-surface interactions. After graduation, I have joined University of Tsukuba and am continuing the fusion-relevant researches, and starting a new research about atmospheric plasma sources and its applications. I love to play football and enjoy watching pro-league games of the League of Legend(LOL).
